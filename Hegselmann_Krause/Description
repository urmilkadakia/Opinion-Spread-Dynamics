This is similar to Deffuant model in which a pair of individual interact, and takes up opinion that is an average of their opinion. 
What happens in Hegselmann_Krause model is that instead of taking one of its neighbors, it selects all of its neighbors. The opinion
that is the average of all the opinions of its neighbors is then adopted by the individual in question.
